## Usage

You can run this application with Docker - just run `make docker build=true` at the command line and navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Setup
### Flask Backend
We've provided a very simple Flask backend - see `src/backend/main.py`

### React Frontend
The React frontend is written in `src/frontend/src/App.js`. You can run it independently of the backend with `npm run start`.
